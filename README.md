# Calculator exercise

This was a code along tutorial from the ["Web Dev Simplified" Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j59qQ7YWLxw).

I initially embarked to create my own calculator after I had a refresher class on buttons, functions, arrays and other Javascript basics. However, I quickly realised that the input, calculations and display functions of a basic calculator were more complex than I thought. 
I swallowed my pride and instead used this tutorial, which is really well explained. However I need to stress, that this is not my orginal code. I simply wanted to have a calculator as one of my projects.
